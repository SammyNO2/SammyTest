		<p>Good Afternoon, </p><br/>
		<p>
			We have reviewed your recent case with Employee Health and have processed 
			COVID pay for your absence during the <b>{0}</b> payroll. Once you review your 
			paycheck for <b>{0}</b> in Self Service, you will see that we processed 
			$<b>{1}</b> for your COVID pay while you were out. You can view the 
			total amount on your paycheck in the "Earnings" section under "STD" 
			for the Northside population and “Non Prod Vaca” for the Gwinnett population.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:20px; padding-bottom:20px">
			The COVID pay that you receive from Northside is based on the <b>{2}</b> 
			Short Term Disability you elected during Annual Enrollment.
			<br/> 
			To get $<b>{1}</b> - you take your base hourly rate x <b>{3}</b> hours 
			you were out during the pay period x <b>{2}</b> STD.
		</p>
		<p>
			As outlined on MyNorthsideHR.com >> “Updates on COVID” slider >> COVID Pay, 
			as of March 2020 Northside is paying out COVID pay to each employee for 10 days 
			total, equivalent to the 2 week elimination period for Short Term Disability. 
			For your status that is <b>{4}</b> hours of time.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:20px; padding-bottom:20px">
			Since March of 2020, you have used <b>{3}</b> hours of your two week elimination 
			period for COVID and you have <b>{4}</b> hours of COVID pay remaining.  
			<br/>
			Once you have used your total two-week elimination period of <b>{4}</b> hours of 
			COVID pay, you would need to request that your timekeeper enter PTO for any 
			future absence due to COVID.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note, if you were out for more than 2 weeks consecutively, you can request 
			a leave of absence with Cigna at (888) 842-4462. Once approved, you will be 
			compensated through CIGNA short term disability for any time missed after the first 
			2 weeks.
			<br/>
			Stay Well,
Benefits Team
